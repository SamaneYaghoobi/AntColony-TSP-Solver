Python Ant Colony TSP Solver
-----------------------------

Uses Ant Colony Optimization to solve the TSP.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms 

anttsp.py is the file to run.  It reads from citiesAndDistances.pickled, which is a pickled 2D array with this format:
CityName1  CityName2 ... CitNameN
0           23               34         
10           0               22
.
.
.

It is not necessary for the matrix to be symmetric i.e. the distance traveling from A to B need not be the distance from B to A  (if you have ever been to Italy and dealt with the mess of one-way streets you will understand how this applies).

Run without additional arguments, it solves the 10-city TSP

You can also try this:
python anttsp.py 14

Other values <= 14 tested as well
